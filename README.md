Implementation

This project allows you to serve your HTML and JS from a custom backend that performs API requests to an external API.

app.js contains the routes that you need to get your data. Customize them according to the paths you wish to use in your code, and the API you wish to access

Write your JS in the javascripts folder; your entry file is index.js.

In the entry file 

A unique single player game where a player must click on circles to cause them to expand.
Additionally, the player must click on "enemy" circles to stop their growth.

Enemy circles can be clicked on to pause their growth and grow at variable rates. If an enemy circle grows into a player circle, both the enemy circle and the player circle stop growing.
The objective of the game is to occupy space up to a target percentage of the area of the canvas for subsequent rounds with progressive difficulty.
